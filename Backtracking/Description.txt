Backtracking approach------>

1.Place yourself on start point
2.Explore all the possible paths from starting point
3.Insert your element at any correct possible position 
4.Once inserted move on to the smaller problems
5.Once you reach all the paths from one point but can't insert the element,then backtrack
	to your previous point
6.Once you reach all the point (base case),print the solution.
