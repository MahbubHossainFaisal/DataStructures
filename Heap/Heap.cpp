/* Heap:
Heap is a complete binary tree. Means,if we store it to the array there will be
no gap between the elements.Duplicate data are allowed in heap.
Mostly they are represented as array.Height of heap will always be log(n) as it is
complete binary tree.

Conditions :
1.Must be binary tree.
2.Max Heap: Every nodes should have the elements greater than or equal to it's descendants(children)
3.Min Heap: Every nodes should have the elements smaller than or equal to it's descendants.(children)
