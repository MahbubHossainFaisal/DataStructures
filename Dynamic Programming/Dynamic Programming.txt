Dynamic programming approach -------->
1.We first devide the problem into subproblems
2.Then the subproblems has many common works.
3.When we find common works we will store that.
4.So,when we we find repeatation we can use the stored information.
5.This will make programme work more faster because we don't have to recalculate anything again
that we had calculated before.

This is dynamic programming.
