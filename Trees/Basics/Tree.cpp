Introduction:
Tree is a collection of nodes and among those nodes,one node is
taken as root node.Rest of the nodes are taken as disjoint subsets.
Each subsets is a tree again or a subtree again.

Root -> The first node of the tree.

Parent -> A node is a parent to it's very next descendants.

children -> descendants which are connected by a single edge with a node.

Siblings -> Children of same parents.

Descendants -> they are the sets of nodes which can be reached from
a particular node downwards.

Ancestors -> Between the path of two particular nodes,all other nodes
along the path are called ancestors.

Degree of a node -> Number of direct children of a particular node.

Leaf Nodes -> Nodes with degree 0 are leaf nodes./External nodes./Terminal nodes

Non-Leaf Nodes -> Nodes with degrees > 0 are non-leaf nodes/internal nodes/non-terminal nodes.

Levels -> starts from 1 and Horizontally measured .

Height -> Root is of height 0,So height of a tree starts from 0 onwards till the last reachable node.

Forest -> A collection of tree is a forest.

Binary tree -> Every node can have max true children min 0 children.
